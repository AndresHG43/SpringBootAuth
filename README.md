# Auth Application example

## Steps for execute in Linux 
- Copy the `.env.docker.example` file to an `.env.example` file.
- Copy the `application.example.yml` file to an `application.yml` file int `authorization/src/main/resources` route.
- Fill the `.env.example` file with the database's credentials.
  - It's recommended that the root password variable be different from that of the read user.
- Create the keys to encrypt the jwt.
  - With Openssl, run: `openssl genrsa > private.key 2048` and `openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key`.
  - Copy the files into `authorization/src/main/resources`.
- Execute `docker compose pull` and later `docker compose up -d` commands.
- Run the `initDataBase.sh` file with `./initDataBase.sh` command.
- Run the `InitUserDb.sh` file with `./InitUserDb.sh` command.
- Replace the username and password fields in the `application.yml` file for `POSTGRES_READ_USER` and `POSTGRES_READ_PASSWORD` env values.
- Run the `executeApp.sh` file with `./executeApp.sh` command.
- Generate a crypted password with the endpoint `generate-password` in the AuthController.
  - Use this password in the `data.sql` file. Also add your own credentials for the first User for the App.
- Run the `insertData.sh` file with `./insertData.sh` command.
